# School Test Passing Rates

Two large files containing data on school math and reading test scores were merged and analyzed to determine what trends may account for schools' test scores. Several calculations were completed once the data was cleaned to tease out deeper-level comparisons. 

One of the largest trends noticed was that charter schools outperformed private schools in math and reading test passing rates, as well as overall passing rates. This is also closely related to the school size's correlation to scores. Large schools had significantly lower passing rates. Of note is that all district schools were classified as large while only one charter school was large. The large charter school performed similarly to other charter schools, not like district schools. While there was only one large charter school to consider, this preliminary evaluation shows that charter schools are more successful than district schools.

Another interesting point of analysis is that schools which spent more per student performed significantly worse than schools spending less per student. The reason for this is unclear and requires additional evaluation.
